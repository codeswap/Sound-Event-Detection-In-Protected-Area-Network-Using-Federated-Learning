# Sound Event Detection in Protected Area Network Using Federated Learning

![Project Banner](assets/banner.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting sound events in a protected area network using **Federated Learning**. It ensures **privacy** by training models across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, thus maintaining data confidentiality and security.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **MATLAB**: The primary language used for implementing the sound event detection algorithms.
- **Federated Learning**: The technique used to train models across decentralized devices.
- **Librosa**: A Python package for audio and music analysis (useful for preprocessing audio data).
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Frameworks that can be used for implementing federated learning (if any parts are implemented in Python).
