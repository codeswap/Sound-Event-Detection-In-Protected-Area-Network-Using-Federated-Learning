# Sound Event Detection in Protected Area Network Using Federated Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting sound events in a protected area network using **Federated Learning**. It ensures **privacy** by training models across decentralized devices without sharing raw data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Federated Learning (TF Federated)
- Librosa (for audio processing)
